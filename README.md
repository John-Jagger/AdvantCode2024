# AdvantCode2024 🎄

## Introduction ☃️
# Hello!

    I’m John Jagger, a junior studying Computer Science at the Colorado School of Mines. For most of my coding journey, my projects have been class assignments. Until now, I hadn’t ventured much into personal coding projects—this is my first attempt!

    Recently, a friend encouraged me to participate in this year’s "Advent of Code." At first, I wasn’t familiar with it, but after looking into it, I found the idea of solving Christmas-themed coding challenges both fun and exciting. I decided to create this repository to document my progress and growth throughout the event.

    Thank you for taking the time to check out my work! While this is my first "Advent of Code," I hope you enjoy exploring my journey and the solutions I’ve crafted.
